# MyFlixAngularClient

The MyFlixAngularClient is a web application that provides users with information about movies, directors, and genres. Users can create an account, log in, and save data about their favorite movies. The application allows users to browse through a collection of movies, view details about each movie, and access additional information about the director and genre of the movie.
